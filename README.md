# Senior Undergrad Research Thesis
Gender Fairness Analysis in AI-Based Depression Detection Systems | Senior Undergraduate Thesis at Brown University
Balestriero Lab

The [src/](https://github.com/selenajwilliams/thesis/tree/main/src) folder contains my original data preprocessing and visualization code based on this paper: [Gender-Aware Estimation of Depression Severity Level in a Multimodal Setting](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9534330)

Note that the submoduled repos are open-source repos for this task I attempted to use (with many bugs and discrepancies along the way). See [this repo](https://github.com/selenajwilliams/depression-detection.git) for a fuller pipeline for audio-based deptression detection
